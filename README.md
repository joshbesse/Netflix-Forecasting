# Netflix-Forecasting
Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of TV shows, movies, and documentaries. Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California. It initially started as a DVD rental service; however, it has evolved into a subscription-based streaming service. It also started producing its own content in 2013, known as Netflix Originals. The data given is quarterly data from 2010 to 2019 and includes Netflix’s total revenue, US GDP, US CPI, US unemployment, and US personal disposable income. The goal is to create a proficient model in forecasting Netflix’s revenue, determine if Netflix producing its own content has been worthwhile in terms of eventual revenue, and verify if Netflix is recession-proof or not. To determine the “best” forecasting model, a multiple regression model, an exponential smoothing model, an ARIMA model, and a combination model will be employed. The performance of each model will be judged based on its mean squared error (MSE).
